All portable Apps are based on [dwarfs](https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs), to compress their runners and use less disc space.

I want to make portable apps with all includet dependencies like: <br />
[Lutris Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/Lutris-Portable) <br />
[Settlers 2 RTTR Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/s25-RTTR-Portable) <br />
[Mindustry Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/Mindustry-Portable) <br />
